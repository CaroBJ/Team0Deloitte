## Segmentation of Car parts 
Deep learning project for course xxxxx at DTU

The project involves segmentation of car parts in collaboration with Deloitte consulting using Unet and Pix2Pix GAN.

## Data
The data available to produce the main results is available in the data folder. To produce the test results use the file Prossed_data_test_ny.npy

## Downloading pre-trained models
The pre-trained model for Unet trained on 10% CAD data can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qGRD-ejDguXOLpy0bUU6rFZ6B1ZJxI8R/view?usp=sharing

The pre-trained model for the Unet trained on complete real data can be downloaded here:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AGNZm-OVm6gnVgu91DmoGeaWxBn5YoHO/view?usp=sharing

The pre-trained model for Pix2Pix GAN can be downloaded here: 

## Run the script
To generate the main results use the script xxx and change the path to the data and the trained model to fit your set-up.

We have also uploaded the scripts for training the different models, but the data for this is not provided.
